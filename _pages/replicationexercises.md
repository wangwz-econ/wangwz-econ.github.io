## Structural Estimation

### \[1\] Rust (1987, Econometrica)

- [Summary Slides](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Slides on Rust 1987.pdf)

- One-sentence Summary: Nested fixed point algorithm requires us to first fully solve the conditional value function taken the parameters as known and then maximize the log-likelihood by going through parameter values.


### \[2\] Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models (2010, Annual Review of Economics)

- [Summary Slides](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Slides on Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models.pdf)

- One-sentence Summary: If the model contains certain terminal or renewal actions, it is easy to express the conditional probability function as a function of conditional choice probabilities, which can be nonparametrically estimated in the data. 

- Empirical Examples: Murphy (2018, AEJ: Economic Policy) 
    -- Land development as a terminal decision in a land supply model.
