## Simple Dynamic Discrete Choice Models

1. [Notes](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Slides on Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models.pdf) on Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models (2010, Annual Review of Economics): A great formulation of the class of dynamic discrete choice problems

<!--- 
- Summary: If the choice set contains certain terminal or renewal decisions, to estimate the parameters, it is useful to express the conditional value function as a function of conditional choice probabilities, which can be nonparametrically estimated in the data.

2. [Notes](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Notes on JoE 2010 Review.pdf) on Dynamic Discrete Choice Structural Models: A Survey (2010, Journal of Econometrics): More emphasize on estimation methods

3. Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher (1987, Econometrica)

<!---  
- Summary: Nested fixed point algorithm requires us to first obtain the ex ante value function by solving a contraction mapping and form the log-likelihood function, taken the parameters as known, and then maximize the log-likelihood by going through all possible parameter values.
