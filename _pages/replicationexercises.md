## Structural Estimation


### Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models (2010, Annual Review of Economics)

- [Paper Notes](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Slides on Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models.pdf): A Great Formulation of General Dynamic Discrete Choice Problems
<!--- 
- Summary: If the choice set contains certain terminal or renewal decisions, to estimate the parameters, it is useful to express the conditional value function as a function of conditional choice probabilities, which can be nonparametrically estimated in the data.

### Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher (1987, Econometrica)

- [Paper Notes](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Slides on Rust 1987.pdf); [Replication Notes](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Rust 1987 Replication Notes.pdf); [Replication Codes](https://github.com/wangwz-econ/Rust-1987)
<!---  - Summary: Nested fixed point algorithm requires us to first obtain the ex ante value function by solving a contraction mapping and form the log-likelihood function, taken the parameters as known, and then maximize the log-likelihood by going through all possible parameter values. --->
