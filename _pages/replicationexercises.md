## Structural Estimation

### \[1\] Rust (1987, Econometrica)

- [Notes](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Slides on Rust 1987.pdf) 

- [Replication Exercises](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Rust 1987 Replication Notes.pdf) [Replication Codes](https://github.com/wangwz-econ/Rust-1987)

- One-Sentence Summary: Nested fixed point algorithm requires us to first fully obtain the ex ante value function by solving a contraction mapping and form the log-likelihood function, taken the parameters as known, and then maximize the log-likelihood by going through all possible parameter values.


### \[2\] Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models (2010, Annual Review of Economics)

- [Notes](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Slides on Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models.pdf)

- One-Sentence Summary: If the choice set contains certain terminal or renewal decisions, to estimate the parameters, it is useful to express the conditional value function as a function of conditional choice probabilities, which can be nonparametrically estimated in the data.
