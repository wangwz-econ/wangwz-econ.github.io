## Structural Estimation

### \[1\] Rust (1987, Econometrica)

- [Notes](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Slides on Rust 1987.pdf) [Replication Exercises](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/rust1987)

- One-Sentence Summary: Nested fixed point algorithm requires us to first fully obtain the conditional value function by solving a contraction mapping, taken the parameters as known and then maximize the log-likelihood by going through parameter values.


### \[2\] Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models (2010, Annual Review of Economics)

- [Notes](https://wangwz-econ.github.io/files/Slides on Practical Methods for Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models.pdf)

- One-Sentence Summary: If the model contains certain terminal or renewal actions, to estimate the parameters, it is useful to express the conditional value function as a function of conditional choice probabilities, which can be nonparametrically estimated in the data. 

- Empirical Examples: Murphy (2018, AEJ: Economic Policy) 

    -- Land development as a terminal decision in a dynamic land supply model.
