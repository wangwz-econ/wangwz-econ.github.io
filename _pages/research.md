## \[1\] Fertility Restrictions and Old-age Labor Supply: Evidence from China's "Later, Longer, Fewer" Campaign
[Latest Version](https://wangwz95.github.io/Documents/Fertility-Restrictions-and-Old-age-labor-supply.pdf)
Abstract: We examine how "Later, Longer, Fewer" (LLF) campaign in the early 1970s affects the labor supply behavior of the elderly parents forty years later. Under our measurement, it explains about 30% of fertility drop in the decade of its implementation. The campaign yields 27.8% increase in possibility of having work for the old. And this effect is totally driven by women in the rural region. A typical rural woman under the policy will be about 50% more likely to engage in work than the sample average. And the effect is mitigated for families who receive more economic transfer from their children, partly suggesting the mechanism behind this effect. In the end, we also draw a blueprint for how this topic should be extended and further analysed.
