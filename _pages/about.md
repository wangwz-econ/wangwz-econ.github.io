# Wenzhi Wang (王文郅)

I am Wenzhi Wang, a Mphil student at the University of Oxford.

Statements of My Fields of Interest

- Structural Labour Economics, Macro Labour Economics, Public Economics
- I am interested in empirical economics research, with special focus on the labour market and unique public policies in China. I am also open to other meaningful empirical questions around the world.
- I am not satisfied with just running regressions and would like to get more training in structural modelling methods because certain important policy debates cannot be easily evaluated through design-based methods.
